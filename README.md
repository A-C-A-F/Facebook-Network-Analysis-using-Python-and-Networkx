# Facebook-Network-Analysis-using-Python-and-Networkx
Facebook Network Analysis using Python and Networkx


In this project, we're going to work with Facebook Friends Network graph. In this graph, each nodes represent a Facebook account, and the edge between two nodes indicate
that those two accounts are friends. We are going to load this data set and visualized it using Python networkX module.
The goal of this analysis is to explore some important characteristics of this graph, such as finding most important nodes on the graph.
And we're going to investigate if this graph is actually representing skill free network.

 __Data Source:__ *https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arielfelices/acaf-dataset-collection?select=Facebook_Friends_Network.txt*

Each line in the dataset that we're going to work with have two numbers. Each of these numbers is the node ID. And in each line we have one of the edges in our graph.

### Below are the key objectives of this project:
1.	Learn to work with graph datasets and visualizing it using Networkx module in Python 
2.	Learn about different centrality measures and how to calculate them 
3.	Learn about scale-free networks and associated properties

### Below is the summary of the tasks performed in this project:
- __Task 1:__ Introduction to project and Importing the dataset 
- __Task 2:__ Visualizing the graph using Networkx 
- __Task 3:__ Calculating some important measures of the graph 
- __Task 4:__ Using Degree and Load Centrality measures to find important nodes in the graph.
- __Task 5:__ Proving Facebook network Graph is a Scale-free network
